#+title: Meta-Programming

Meta-programming is a programming technique in which computer programs are written by other programs.

** Template Meta-Programming (TMP)
Code is generated using pre-defined templates and then merged with the rest of the source code. Alternatively, entire standalone libraries can be generated and called from the *main* program.

*** TMP examples
- [[id:5184f721-f61a-4ea3-a6d0-a82c08bf8e76][Protocol Buffers]] compiler: generates classes/structs/... based on definitions written in Protobuf.

** Macros
A macro is a computer program that given a certain input will produce a new program as output. Macros do this by operating directly on the abstract syntax tree (AST), returning a new AST as a result; this makes it possible for macros to extend the programming language's existing syntax.

*** Macros examples
- LISP
- [[id:51365aa8-e8d4-4e55-b907-dea389baee9d][Meta-Programming (Elixir)]]
